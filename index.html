    <h2>WHY LISBON?</h2>
    <h3> Lisbon,the city of seven hills</h3>
    <p> 
      The legend has it that Lisbon was named Olissipo by the
       Romans, for its resemblance to the Roman capital. Just like
       Rome, Lisbon began its life as a humble settlement nestled
       among seven hills. However, it wasn't until the 17th
       century, in the writing of Frey Nicolao d'Oliveira, that
       Lisbon came to be called 'a cidade das sete colinas' - 
       the city of seven hills.
    </p>
      <p>
      You can still see traces of ancient Lisbon today. Beyond the array
      of shops with international brands, peaceful streetside cafes
      selling the iconic pastel de nata and world class restaurants
      with a variety of global cuisine, you can still wander the
      seven hills and see the city from above, taking in the rolling
      terracotta rooftops, the whitewashed walls and on the horizon,
      the soft blue sea.
